# Instruction for contributors

> **Note**: _The project strictly uses `poetry` package manager so do not push
> any `requirements.txt` file or other package management files._

Rules to contribute to projects:

- The main goal of this project is to unify payment process so we must inherit
  abstract classes for creating a new payment method.

- Do not use highly offensive or racist words anywhere including variable names,
  examples, and requirement specification.

- The solution should be capable of running on all operating systems.
  If not, mention in the respective section in documentation


## Placeholders
Placeholders are not strict and we may use any name for them, but please try to
name them so that everyone who understands English can understand them properly.

We may use name of fictional characters of Sci-fi movies too
but we should make sure that those names should not impact sentiments of people
of any region, race, or gender.

Examples of some placeholders:

1. **Person**: `John Doe` `Darth Vader`, `Sheldon`, `Iron Man`, `Yoda`, etc.
2. **Place**: `High Street`, `Wakanda`, `Vulkan`, `Tatooine`, etc.
3. **Organization**: `Ace`, `Galactic Republic`, `Jedi`, `Enterprise`, ``, etc.
4. **Domain Names** `example.com`, `starwars.com`, `johndoe.com`, etc.
